##  Fitzgerald is a tiny PHP framework that was inspired oh so heavily by the wondrous Sinatra of the Ruby world.
### This is an unofficial-official maintenance fork of Fitzgerald, and the only one under semi-active development.

See example.php for a look at how to use Fitzgerald, and read the blog posts:

### Features added to my fork:

* Added ['splat'] named-variable array to mimic Sinatra's /wildcard/* routes.

### Roadmap

* Integrate Fitzgerald with Composer for dependency management.
